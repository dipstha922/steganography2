## Steganography

Algorithm to encode a secret message in the carrier file.
carrier files could be image, audio or videos.

For the above problem Algorithm such as __Least Significant Bit__ was used.

Created user friendly interference so that 
anyone can easily encrypt their data inside the carrier file desired by them, the message 
that is in encrypted file can be extracted by using the similar algorithm used to encode the 
message. Also, we used LSMT to generate audio where people could use audio that is 
auto generated by our system, and encrypt their message in it.
